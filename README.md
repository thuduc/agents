Agents for a sampling of agentic use-cases

## Agent Portfolio

* **The Monthly Runbook Agent** addresses a critical operational pain point by automating the 24-48 hours of manual production processes our L2 operators execute monthly, including ETL runs, modeling data publishing, while intelligently monitoring upstream data availability.

* **The Security Vulnerability Agent** tackles our growing security and compliance challenges by continuously scanning our code repositories for vulnerabilities and providing real-time threat detection in our software.
